    <section id="intro">
        <p class="name">Hi, my name is <span> Matei Giurgiu </span> </p>
        <p>I'm a results-driven software developer with a burning passion for crafting high-performing applications and
            platforms.<br> My expertise lies in both backend development with .NET and frontend magic with React.<br>

            üíª Clean code is not just a practice but a way of life for me!<br> I take pride in writing elegant and
            maintainable code that not only gets the job done but stands the test of time. üßπ<br>

            üìà Scalability is the heart of any successful software, and I thrive in architecting systems that can grow
            exponentially. Building robust and scalable applications is where I shine! üí™<br>

            ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud computing is the future, and I'm all in! I've had the privilege of working with both Azure and AWS,
            leveraging the power of the cloud to optimize and enhance application performance.</p>
        <p> Nice to meet you ! </p>

                        <h2 class="blackbox">Full Stack Developer</h2>
                        <p class="blackbox">In my previous role, I served as a full stack developer, primarily focusing
                            on the backend, where I was tasked with building a comprehensive application in the finance
                            field from the ground up.</p>
                        <p class="blackbox">The application comprised a .NET API with a Microsoft SQL database,
                            complemented by a Single Page Application (SPA) developed using React Typescript.</p>
                        <p class="blackbox">During this experience, I gained valuable insights into various aspects of
                            web development, including technologies such as .NET, React, Azure DevOps, and Git. I also
                            had the opportunity to delve into processes and work extensively with services provided by
                            Microsoft Azure.</p>
                        <p class="blackbox">My role involved applying design patterns, utilizing knowledge of data
                            structures and algorithms, and contributing to the overall development and enhancement of
                            the application.</p>
                        <p class="blackbox">Additionally, I was responsible for data migration between database schemas,
                            a task that required the development of a .NET application to facilitate the seamless
                            transition from one schema to another.</p>

                        <p>In this role, during the initial months, I worked with a desktop application written using
                            .NET and Windows Forms. This experience provided valuable insights into the structure of a
                            .NET project, debugging techniques, and the process of migrating from .NET Framework to .NET
                            6. Additionally, I had a brief interaction with a frontend application developed using
                            microfrontends.</p>
                        <p>Subsequently, my responsibilities expanded to include working on a web application built
                            using microservices architecture, where I took on the role of service owner for some of
                            these microservices. In this phase, I further developed my skills in areas such as
                            microservices development, monitoring and logging practices, MongoDB, Docker, Kubernetes,
                            Veracode, managing pipelines in Azure DevOps, Amazon EC2 and S3, RabbitMQ, and more.</p>
